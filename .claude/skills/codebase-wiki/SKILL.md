# Codebase wiki — how to work here

This project holds an **agent-authored wiki of its codebase** — DeepWiki, but living in the repo. A coding agent reads the source and writes a navigable, diagram-rich, source-grounded wiki as plain markdown under `wiki/`. It is version-controlled and diffable, human+agent co-editable, and doubles as durable grounding context for future agent sessions. There is no separate Q&A surface — Q&A is "an agent that has read these pages + `grep`".

## The shape

```
wiki/
  OVERVIEW.md     hub: what it is, a big-picture architecture diagram, a nav map to every section.
                  Frontmatter carries `profile` (audience/depth) + `source_commit` (freshness anchor).
  architecture/   system boundaries, layers, subsystems, cross-cutting concerns + diagrams
  modules/        one page per package / module: purpose, entry points, key files, deps
  flows/          key end-to-end flows as sequence / flow diagrams + narrative
  concepts/       glossary: atomic pages for domain terms / core abstractions
  guides/         task-oriented "how / where do I change X" (filled at depth >= standard)
```

## Generating + refreshing

Don't free-hand it — read **[references/generate-and-refresh.md](references/generate-and-refresh.md)** and follow the phased, STOP-gated procedure. It auto-detects mode: a stubbed `OVERVIEW.md` (empty `source_commit`) → **generate** (survey → overview → architecture → modules → flows → concepts → link audit); a stamped `source_commit` → **refresh** (diff `source_commit..HEAD`, update only affected pages, re-stamp).

**Plain files, native tools.** Read source and write wiki pages with the native tools (`Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`Edit`/`Write`/`Bash`). Nothing checks links for you: after every write, confirm each relative link resolves from the page's own folder, and run the link audit from the reference after a generate or refresh.

## The two knobs

Two natural-language knobs, read from the user's request (e.g. "build the wiki, public and exhaustive") and recorded in `OVERVIEW.md` frontmatter (`profile: <audience>/<depth>`) so refreshes stay consistent:

- **`audience`** — `internal` (default) or `public`. `public` means polished prose, no secrets / internal infra / ticket numbers, and GitHub-URL source references.
- **`depth`** — `tour` | `standard` (default) | `exhaustive`. Scales coverage from OVERVIEW + architecture + top flows up through per-package module pages, concepts, and task guides.

[references/generate-and-refresh.md](references/generate-and-refresh.md) is the authoritative source for exactly how each knob shapes the output — read it before generating.

## Source-reference convention

- **Intra-wiki navigation** → relative markdown links to the page file (`[Auth flow](../flows/auth.md)`). They are the navigation graph, so link liberally; density is how the wiki stays navigable. `grep -rl "flows/auth.md" wiki` finds a page's backlinks.
- **Code references** → relative links + symbol code-spans (`internal`) or GitHub blob URLs (`public`). Count the `../` hops from the page's folder: a page in `wiki/modules/` reaches `src/` through `../../src/`. Nothing flags a wrong-depth path, so check that the target exists. Never invent paths — reference only files you actually read.

The full rules — the GitHub-URL / relative fallback, the `#Lxx` caveat, and the exact code-span shape — live in [references/generate-and-refresh.md](references/generate-and-refresh.md).

## Per-folder rules

**`architecture/`** — One page per architectural area (boundaries, layers, subsystems, cross-cutting concerns). Each: a `mermaid` system-context or component diagram, key components (with source refs), and the design decisions behind them. Headings: Summary, Diagram, Key components, Design decisions, Related. At `depth: tour`, modules fold in here.

**`modules/`** — One page per package / module: purpose, responsibilities, public API / entry points, key files (linked per the convention), dependencies, and flows it participates in. Headings: Summary, Responsibilities, Public API / entry points, Key files, Dependencies, Participates in, Related. Skipped at `tour`; sub-module depth scales with the knob.

**`flows/`** — Key end-to-end sequences as `mermaid` sequence / flow diagrams + narrative. Headings: Summary, Trigger, Sequence diagram, Steps, Failure modes (only at `exhaustive`), Related. Link every module and concept the flow crosses.

**`concepts/`** — Atomic glossary pages (one term each): definition, why it matters, where it lives in the code. Headings: Definition, Why it matters, Where it lives, Related. Keep small and densely cross-linked so each concept becomes a hub.

**`guides/`** — Task-oriented "how / where do I change X" walkthroughs. Headings: Goal, Steps, Relevant code, Gotchas, Related. Populated at `standard`, rich at `exhaustive`, thin/empty at `tour`.

## Freshness discipline (MUST)

`OVERVIEW.md` frontmatter carries `source_commit` — the git HEAD the wiki was last generated/refreshed against. It is the freshness anchor: refresh mode diffs `source_commit..HEAD` to update only the affected pages, then re-stamps it. **Always re-stamp `source_commit` after a generate or refresh run** — a stale anchor silently breaks incremental refresh.

## Page skeleton

Every page starts with this frontmatter, then an H1 equal to `title` and the folder's headings as H2:

```markdown
---
title: <Page title>
description: "<one sentence on what the page covers>"
type: <architecture | module | flow | concept | guide>
tags:
  - wiki
  - <type>
---
# <Page title>
```

`OVERVIEW.md` carries `profile` and `source_commit` instead of `type`, and the tag `overview`. Headings carry only structure; what each section is for is described above and in the reference, not repeated inside page bodies.
