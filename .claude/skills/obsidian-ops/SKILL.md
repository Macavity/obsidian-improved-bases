# Obsidian Operations Skill

This skill covers the operational aspects of maintaining an Obsidian project, including build workflows and release management.

## Purpose

To ensure reliable builds, consistent reference materials, and safe release processes while strictly following project policies.

## Scope

This skill covers:
- Build and lint workflows
- Version management and release preparation
- Build and environment troubleshooting

## Core Rules

- **NEVER perform automatic git operations**: AI agents must never execute `git commit`, `git push`, or any command that automatically stages or commits changes without explicit user approval for each step.
- **Verify Build**: Always run a build/lint after significant changes to ensure compatibility.
