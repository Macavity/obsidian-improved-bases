# Release

The GitHub workflow `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds, attests and publishes on a tag push. This skill covers everything before that push and the check afterwards. Background on the mechanism: `.claude/skills/obsidian-ops/references/versioning-releases.md`.

Three facts drive every step. Never work around them.

1. **The release notes are the `## [<version>]` section of `CHANGELOG.md`.** The workflow extracts that section; when it is missing it warns and publishes with the compare link only. Commit messages play no role; the history is not clean enough for that. A release without a section is the user's explicit choice (a quick hotfix), never a default.
2. **The tag equals `manifest.json`'s `version`, no `v` prefix.** The workflow titles the release from the manifest.
3. **`versions.json` gets a new key only when `minAppVersion` changed.** `version-bump.mjs` enforces this. A release whose newest key is older than the version is correct, not a bug. Do not add keys by hand.

## 1. Preconditions

Run all of these; a failed one stops the release until fixed.

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch main && git pull --ff-only
git status --short            # must be empty
gh pr list --state open       # releases wait for nothing that should be in them
git log --oneline $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD
```

- Release only from `main`, never from a feature branch. The community directory reads `manifest.json` from the head of the default branch.
- Dirty working tree or a checked-out feature branch: those changes are not part of the release. Ask the user whether to commit them on their branch, stash them, or leave them out, before switching to `main`. Never carry uncommitted changes into the bump commit.
- Compare against `origin/main`, not a stale local view. "The branch is ahead of main" after a merged PR means the local `main` is old.
- Zero commits since the last tag → nothing to release. Say so and stop.

## 2. Pick the version

Base the proposal on **user-visible change**, not commit subjects. Read the diff of `src/`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` and `README.md` since the last tag:

```bash
LAST=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
git diff --stat "$LAST"..HEAD -- src styles.css manifest.json README.md
git diff "$LAST"..HEAD -- manifest.json README.md
```

Pre-1.0 rules for this plugin:

| Change since last tag | Bump |
| --- | --- |
| Removes or renames a setting, property type, command, or changes stored data | **minor** (state the break in the notes) |
| Any new feature or new user-facing behaviour | **minor** |
| Only fixes, docs, tooling, refactors | **patch** |
| `minAppVersion` raised | at least **minor**; `versions.json` gets a new key automatically |

Present the version with the two or three changes that justify it, and wait for the user's confirmation. Never bump before that.

## 3. Gate

All of it, every release, no matter how small the diff. CI ran on the PR, but the merge commit on `main` is a different tree.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check                    # typecheck + lint + test (coverage) + fallow
pnpm build
```

Then the automated section of `.claude/skills/obsidian-ops/references/release-readiness.md`: files at root, manifest consistent (`package.json` and `manifest.json` versions equal after the bump), no stray console output, README disclosures. Report each item as pass or fail with a concrete fix. The interactive section (platform and mobile testing) is a question to the user, answered by them, not assumed.

A gate failure is fixed on `main` in its own commit before the bump, or the release is called off. Never bump on top of a red gate.

## 4. CHANGELOG and README

**CHANGELOG.md** (Keep a Changelog format). Compare the `## [Unreleased]` section against the diff from step 2: every user-visible change since the last tag must be listed, nothing else (no spikes, review fixes, wiki stamps, tooling). Fill the gaps, written for a plugin user, present tense, no commit hashes. Then turn `## [Unreleased]` into `## [<version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>`, add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it, and update the compare links at the bottom (`[Unreleased]: .../compare/<version>...HEAD`, `[<version>]: .../compare/<previous>...<version>`). Subsections: `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`, only those with content. This format wins over the "Summarize for Release" layout in `obsidian-ops/references/summarize-commands.md`.

**README.md**. For each item in the new section, check that the README still describes the behaviour correctly: "What it does", "Where it works" and its Limits, "Schema format", "Commands", "Settings", "Unsupported Obsidian versions" when `minAppVersion` changed. Fix what is stale in the same commit as the bump. "The README was updated in the feature PR" is a claim to verify by reading, not an answer.

Show the finished CHANGELOG section and any README diff to the user together with the version.

## 5. Bump, commit, tag

Only after the user confirmed version, CHANGELOG section and README changes.

```bash
pnpm version <patch|minor> --no-git-tag-version
```

This writes `package.json` and `manifest.json` and stages `manifest.json` and `versions.json` only. `package.json` stays unstaged, so add it explicitly:

```bash
git add package.json manifest.json versions.json CHANGELOG.md README.md
git diff --cached              # version lines, the CHANGELOG section, README fixes, nothing else
```

Commit and tag:

```bash
git commit -m "Release 0.2.0"
git tag 0.2.0
```

Check `git show --stat HEAD` and `git tag --points-at HEAD` before pushing.

The release commit touches no code, so the wiki refresh rule from `CLAUDE.md` does not apply to it. If the wiki is stale from earlier work, that is a separate commit before the bump.

## 6. Push and publish

Pushing the tag is the outward, irreversible step. Ask once more, naming the version; proceed on an explicit yes only.

Two separate commands, in this order, with a short pause in between. A combined push can drop the workflow trigger.

```bash
git push origin main
```

```bash
git push origin 0.2.0
```

Then verify, do not assume:

```bash
gh run list --workflow=release.yml -L 1
gh run watch                   # until the run completes
gh release view 0.2.0          # title = version, assets main.js, manifest.json, styles.css, body = CHANGELOG section
```

Workflow did not fire: follow "Pushing tags so the workflow actually fires" in `versioning-releases.md` (`gh workflow run release.yml --ref main` is the recovery path). Never create the release by hand in the UI as a first resort; that skips the build attestation.

Report the release URL and the asset list to the user.

## Rationalizations that end releases badly

- "Tiny change, skip `pnpm check`." The gate runs on every release. Say out loud if you skip it, and only on the user's instruction.
- "The Unreleased section already has entries, that's the changelog done." Check it against the diff; entries are added during feature work only sometimes.
- "I'll write the notes into the tag or commit message instead." The workflow reads only `CHANGELOG.md`; without the section the release has no notes.
- "It's a hotfix, skip the changelog." Only when the user says so; one `### Fixed` line takes a minute.
- "The README was touched in the PR, it's current." Read the sections named in step 4 against the change.
- "I'll push main and the tag together to save a step." Dropped workflow, release without attestation.
- "versions.json's newest key is stale, I'll fix it." It is correct unless `minAppVersion` changed.
- "The PR branch has everything, I'll tag here." Tags live on `main`.
- "The user said release, that covers the push." Version, CHANGELOG and README are confirmed first; the tag push is confirmed separately.
- "CI was green on the PR." The merge commit is a different tree; run the gate on `main`.

Red-flag phrases: "should be fine", "I'll just", "basically the same as the PR", "no need to wait for the run".
